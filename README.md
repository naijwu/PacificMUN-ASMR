# PacificMUN-ASMR
Originally what was supposed to be the "Automated System for MUN Registration," it turned into a "Assistance System for MUN Registration." All the files to have it work as intended are there, but some of the code is altered (in index.php) to skip the automation component of the system (instead, registration inputs went straight to the database, after checks of course)

Had two weeks to make a system. Not my greatest work, but I think the idea behind it is cool. It would've been even cooler if it worked as  intended. A lot of my conventions with php (in relation to mysql) are somewhat outdated, I think. 

The repository includes the registration, Delegate Affair control panel, and the country matrix.

There is one database called "ASMR," with X amount of tables, where X = the amount of committees + 1;
 - One of the tables is named "DelReg", which contains all the input from the registrants
 - The other tables are the committees

The flow of the program was supposed to work like this
 - *let me return to this later* 

Some of the code in the program has been omitted until the registration ends for PacificMUN (For exploitation reasons)
